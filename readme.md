Cool Triangle Animation Effect with JavaScript
This is a simple JavaScript code that generates a cool triangle pattern animation effect. It creates a canvas element and draws randomly moving colored triangles on it. The triangles bounce off the edges of the canvas, creating an engaging visual effect.

Usage
Simply include the provided index.js file in your HTML document, and the animation will start automatically. No additional setup is required.

Features
Generates random colored triangles.
Triangles move randomly within the canvas.
Triangles bounce off the edges of the canvas, creating a dynamic effect.
How It Works
Canvas Creation: The code creates a canvas element and appends it to the HTML body.

Triangle Class: A JavaScript class Triangle is defined to represent each triangle. It includes properties such as position, size, color, and speed.

Triangle Generation: Random triangles are generated and stored in an array.

Animation Loop: The animate function is called recursively using requestAnimationFrame(). Within this function, the canvas is cleared, each triangle's position is updated, and then redrawn.
